/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0: Variables traditonally thought of as containers for values. Alternately, they can be thought of something more like 
 * octopus tentacles that point at certain values. This metaphor allows us to think of variables as something that can be 
 * redefined (the tentacle can stop pointing at one value andm move to point at another value) and shows that multiple variables
 * can be pointed at the same value. 
 * 
 * 1: Declaration and assignment: to create a variable in js, it is best practice to first declare the variable using 
 * one of the three declarative keywords: var, let, or const. once declared, you can then assign the variable a 
 * value.
 * 
 * 2. Var, let, and: The three variable declaration keywords have various uses and benefits. Var, the original variable declaration
 * keyword, was the only option until ES6, when let and const were introduced to address some of var's limitations.  
 * 
 * 3. Hoisting

/**
 * DATATYPES
 * 
 * 0: Datatypes are the categories that various values fall into. Different datatypes have different properties.
 * Below is a list of data types in JavaScript, explanations of their respective characteristics, as well as explanations of 
 * how the various datatypes behave when copied. 
 * 
 * 1: Number: Numbers are simply numbers. They can be positive, negative, or 0. JS can perform a multitude of arithmetic and mathematical operations
 * on numbers.
 * 
 * 2: String: A string is any text wrapped by '' or "". Strings have a length property and are indexed. These characteristics mean that strings
 *  can be manipulated. But strings are immutable, ie unchangeable, meaning that any string manipulation returns a new string rather than modifying
 * the original string 
 * 
 * 3: Boolean: There are two Boolean values: true and false. These represent the logical outcome of conditional operations like if statements. 
 * 
 * 4: Array: Arrays are complex datatypes that store data as indexed lists. They also have a length property. Beause of this, there are a variety 
 * of methods that can be performed on them to manipulate then. They can be looped over, allowing us to perform an action on every item in the 
 * array. They are mutable, meaning they can be changed destructively. 
 * 
 * 5: Object: Objects are the other complex data type, which store data as key/value pairs called properties. Referencing the object name and key name 
 * allows us to add more values using dot notation or bracket notation.
 * 
 * 6: Function: A function is not strictly a datatype, but rather is an object and is therefore a complex datatype. 
 * 
 * 7: undefined: undefined is a dataype comprised of one value: undefined. It represents the absence of any value. 
 * 
 * 8: null: null is a datatype comprised of one value: null. It is an object that represents the absence of an object.
 * 
 * 9: NaN: NaN stands for Not a Number, and is the result of impossible arithmetic operations. 
 * 
 * 10: Infinity and -Infinity: Represent numbers outside of the defined range that JS can handle. Infinity is greater than any other number and negative infinity 
 * is less than any other number. 
 * 
 * 11: Difference between primitive and complex data types: Arrays and objects (and functions) are complex datatypes; the rest of the datatypes are primitive. 
 * The complex datatypes are mutable and are copy by reference. The primitive datatypes are immutable and are copy by value. 
 * 
 * 12: Copy by value (primitive)/Copy by reference (complex): Pimitive datatypes are copied by value while complex datatypes are copied by reference. 
 * A variable represents a reference to a value and not the value itself.
